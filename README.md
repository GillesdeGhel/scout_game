The game is simple and based on the 100 year wars that raged between France and England in the 14th - 15th century.

# Rules
There is 15 turns. Each turn a patrol can attack a city, defend one, go to the mine or build something. At the end of the turn each patrol receives a bonus in gold and the attacks are solved. If the city falls, the defenders lose money. Each of them loses an amount relative to their part in the defense and the power difference between the attack and defense.

# Base amount
Each patrol starts with 500 and gains 100 * multipliers each turn.
